	<h1>Dr Ian Moores<br /> Principal</h1><br>

	<p>Dr Moores has been the Principal of Ealing Indpendent College for 12 years, and the success that both the College and its students have achieved over the years is very much a result of&nbsp;his passion and drive. He has taught chemistry all his life, and still teach all A-Level Chemists at both AS and A2 level. Being in the classroom and actively contributing to his students&#39; learning and future success is very important to Ian.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>He&nbsp;heralds from the North West &ndash; home city is Liverpool.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>After a successful and privileged education at Calday Grange Grammar School on Wirral, Ian&nbsp;moved to Manchester in 1975 for his&nbsp;tertiary education. His&nbsp;first degree was in Chemistry which led to an offer of a CASE award jointly between Salford University and the international pharmaceutical company, Ciba-Geigy Ltd.&nbsp;The research project involved working with novel heterocyclic organic compounds based on fluorinated Quinoline and Imidazole ring systems. During the three year post, Ian&nbsp;worked jointly at both the University&rsquo;s laboratories and Ciba-Geigy&rsquo;s Tennax Road site (Trafford Park). At the age of 24 he&nbsp;was awarded a Ph.D.</p>

	<p>Studying in Manchester enabled Ian&nbsp;to pursue his&nbsp;considerable musical interests, mainly through the Royal Northern School of Music. He is&nbsp;a classically trained vocalist (Tenor) and a pianist.&nbsp; At the same time he&nbsp;started teaching Chemistry in the evening at Bolton Technical College. It was through this part-time work and through the periodic lectures he had to give at the University as part of his&nbsp;post graduate training that fostered his&nbsp;interest in lecturing and teaching.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Ian has taught at some of the&nbsp;UK&rsquo;s most prestigious HMC boarding and day schools. He was Head of Department and Master in Charge of Athletics at Wellington College (Berks) for five years. He then moved to Bedales School (Hants) as Head of Science for another five years. In his last post before moving to Ealing, Ian was appointed to the Senior Management Team at Cheadle Hulme School (Cheshire). All this experience equipped him well for taking on the role of Principal at Ealing Independent College. Ian has truly managed to integrate the best points of an Independent Sixth Form College with the best aspects of a school to give the College its particular ethos.</p>

    <h3 class="staff_name">Elizabeth Chare <br />Vice Principal (Pastoral Care)</h3>
    <p>Dr Elizabeth Chare has three main roles within the College, namely Vice Principal (Pastoral), Head of Science and Housemistress. Her role as Vice Principal gives  a focus in the pastoral care of our students and as Head of Science ensures a high standard of teaching and learning is maintained in the Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics departments. As Housemistress she is running our first boarding house of up to 10 students which is located just a 5 minute bus ride from the College at Ealing Common. In her role as the Housemistress, Elizabeth is responsible for the pastoral and academic care of students together with the Housekeeper.</p>

	<p>Elizabeth’s passion is to guide the academic and social development of all students ensuring that they achieve their potential at GCSE and A-Level and secure the best possible university place. To this end, Elizabeth has hugely enjoyed running UCAS week this year. This has involved an external careers advisor giving a lecture to students and parents regarding the application process as well as individual sessions with students to discuss their specific university choices. UCAS week has also incorporated sessions where the students have started filling in their online UCAS form as well as assisting with the structure of their personal statements.</p><br>

	<p>Allan teaches History and Geography at the College, and is dedicated to ensuring that academic quality across all subjects consistently meets the high standards which we set for ourselves. He also leads the College's extra-curricular activity programme, providing scope for students to thrive within and beyond their studies whilst coaching the football team, West London Independent College league winners for the last two years.</p>
