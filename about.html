<p>I am pleased to welcome you to Avicenna School of Science and Medicine.</p>

<p>I have been Principal of the School for twelve years and have seen it through all its major developments and changes. The School really does have my stamp on it!</p>

<p>I have taught Chemistry all my working life and still insist on teaching all A-level Chemists at both AS and A2 level. I am passionate about teaching and would not give up my classroom work for anything! I believe that this is where some of the most important work is done, and as Principal I feel I should be very much part of that; apart from anything else, it is how I get to know the students so well.</p>

<p>I have taught in some of the UK’s most prestigious HMC boarding and day schools. I was Head of Department and Master in Charge of Athletics at Wellington College (Berks) for five years. I then moved to Bedales School (Hants) as Head of Science for another five years. In my last post before moving to Avicenna, I was appointed to the Senior Management Team at Cheadle Hulme School (Cheshire). All this experience equipped me well for taking on the role of Principal at Avicenna School of Science and Medicine. I believe that I have managed to integrate the best points of an Independent Sixth Form School with the best aspects of a school to give the College its particular ethos.</p>

<p>When you come to visit during term time, insist on going into classrooms whilst lessons are taking place. You will see how the students take a real interest in their studies and how well they interact with their teacher.</p>

<p>Ensure you visit a supervised study session. You will see how students work well on their own in the quietness of the College’s designated study room. I believe that when students are not in lessons they should be in supervised study and not wasting time in the environs of Avicenna or the student common room.</p>

<p>Look at the students as they walk around the School from lesson to lesson or as they walk in and out of the main entrance, you will see that they look happy and contented.</p>

<p>The School does provide a very supportive environment with its excellent pastoral care which, coupled with the outstanding work that goes on in the classroom enables the students to make strong progress and achieve their very best academically.</p>

<p>Come and visit the School. I would be very happy to talk to you and give you advice. I hope Avicenna School of Science and Medicine will be the right school for you – but there is only one way to find out! I look forward to meeting you.</p>
